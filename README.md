# Currency Converter

## Overview
Currency Converter is a Java-based application that enables users to convert amounts between different currencies using real-time exchange rates. It provides a simple and interactive interface for seamless conversions.

## Features
- Convert between multiple currencies
- Fetch real-time exchange rates from an API (if applicable)
- User-friendly graphical interface (if using GUI) or command-line interface
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Supports multiple decimal precision levels for accurate conversion
- Optimized for performance and efficiency

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Internet connection (if real-time exchange rates are fetched from an API)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CurrencyConverter.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CurrencyConverter
   ```
3. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
